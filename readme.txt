Just a simple WordPress plugin that adds a lightweight, responsive bellhop button that allows any visitors to your site to contact the front desk easily and in several ways.

== Installation ==
Download the plugin from the official WordPress repo and click \'Activate\' when the plugin has finished downloading or download a zip file of the plugin and install it manually.

Upon activation this plugin adds a simple contact menu for phone or email to the bottom of every page, and a 'ConciergeWP' button to the dashboard to allow you to easily customize it. The information displayed by the menu can be set from the WordPress dashboard on the ConciergeWP settings page.  By default, when a user clicks the ConciergeWP icon, additional buttons for email and phone pop out to the left.
