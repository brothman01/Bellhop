## Installation
- Download the .zip from this repository.
- Head to your WordPress admin dashboard and navigate to 'Plugins > Add New' and upload the .zip file you downloaded in step 1.
- Activate the plugin.
- Enjoy :)

## Initial Setup
The plugin adds a simple contact menu for phone or email to the bottom of each page when the small bell icon is pushed.  The information displayed by the menu can be set from the WordPress dashboard in "Settings > ConciergeWP".  By default, when a user clicks the ConciergeWP icon, additional buttons for email and phone pop out to the left.  If the email field on the settings page is not filled out, the email button will not be displayed and the same goes for the phone button.  The ability to add more, custom contact buttons is a planned feature, but at this time it is impossible.
