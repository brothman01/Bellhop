## Initial Setup
Upon activation this plugin adds a simple contact menu for phone or email to the bottom of every page, and a 'Bellhop' button to the dashboard to allow you to easily customize it.

By default, when a user clicks the Bellhop icon, additional buttons for email and phone pop out to the left.
